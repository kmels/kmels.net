<p>Above this text you should see a picture of a snowman, generated by a
Java applet. If you don't see the picture, it may be because your browser
is not set up to process Java applets (the browser needs the Java plug-in),
or because the bytecode version of the applet is not stored in the same
location as this web page.</p>
